Ayaan Qayyum, Ayaan Malik, Juveria Amin, Shanzeh Malik

Our project encrypts music and only allows the rightful owner to play back the music. Implements a scrambling algorithm written completely from scratch in Java. Our website allows for the secure download of the per-user encrypted music, and a separate app, compiled in C, allows for the secure decryption and playback of the music.
